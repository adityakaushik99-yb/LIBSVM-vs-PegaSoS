# LIBSVM-vs-PegaSoS
An Implementation of SVM using LIBSVM and PegaSoS algorithm as a comparative study. This implementation is based on the paper Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/ShalevSiSrCo10.pdf and compares its performance with LIBSVM which is available in the sklearn library. As can be seen from the above comparison that on our generated dataset of 1000 points, a classification based on LIBSVM in 0.011 seconds with an accuracy score of 83.33%
while Pegasos Based SVM model runs on the same dataset in 0.092 seconds with a higher accuracy of 88.67%.
